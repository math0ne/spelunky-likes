  Spelunky is widely regarded as one of the best games of the last decade and has inspired tons of developers to create games in the same vein.  I love these games and I think many others to too so for the last couple years I did a reddit post that collected games in this new micro genre.  It was fairly popular so I have decided to turn it into a small showcase site with my personal rankings on the specific aspects I believe define this genre. The specific aspects are as follows:

  * Randomness
    * Are the levels truly random, or pieced together from pre-built rooms into a metroidvania style interconnected layout.  There are many ways to go about random level generation but the closer to to traditional true random roguelike level generation the better.
  * Character Progression
    * In spelunky you have a couple ways of gearing up through items, in other games it may be a level system or a skill system, doesn't matter as long as your chatacter can progress in some way.
  * 2D Platforming
    * How traditional is the platforming, can you jump on enemies? Can you run?  Is there physics?
  * Permadeath
    * We will accept meta progression, but the further away from real permadeath we get the worse in my opinion.
  * Exploration
    * How many secrets and branching paths does the game have, one of the core tenants of roguelike games this was well represented with spelunky.

I welcome any suggestions or comments, send a pull request or send me a message on github.
