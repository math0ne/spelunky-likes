Very critically acclaimed, this is a really close fit with a slight twist on platforming that makes it less traditional but still super fun.  The main thing that kills this is the level generation is straight medroivanvia box style with waves of enemies.  Somehow it still has some cool exploration but the box levels are somewhat disappointing.
