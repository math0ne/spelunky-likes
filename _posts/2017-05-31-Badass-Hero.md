This game is a looser fit, the levels are pure metroidvania boxes, admittedly cleverly arranged in comic panels.  The game is a twin stick shooter with platforming which I consider on the edge of this genre, this one has a pretty strong emphasis on the platforming and roguelike elements so I have decided to include it.
