Stamina based 2d brawler with souls like elements.  This one is really light on the platforming so I would say it's a loose fit.  Additionally the encounters are randomly generated but they are essentially rooms, not full generated levels.  Some nice minimalistic stylistic pixel art so make this worth a look.
